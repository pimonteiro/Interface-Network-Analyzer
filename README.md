# Interface-Network-Analyzer
Analyzes if a interface is getting dumped from the network or if the internet is having connection problems.

Currently i have a device connected to the network but constantly getting disconnected. The problem: i don't know if it is a wifi issue or a problem on the device.
So this little python program will be running 24/7, on a raspberry pi, tracking the state of both network wifi and device. A the end of a week i'll know what the source of the problem is.
